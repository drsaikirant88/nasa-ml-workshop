    "NVIDIA created RAPIDS – an open-source data analytics and machine learning acceleration platform that leverages GPUs to accelerate computations. RAPIDS is based on Python, has Pandas-like and Scikit-Learn-like interfaces, is built on Apache Arrow in-memory data format, and can scale from 1 to multi-GPU to multi-nodes. RAPIDS integrates easily into the world’s most popular data science Python-based workflows. RAPIDS accelerates data science end-to-end – from data prep, to machine learning, to deep learning.\n",
    "\n",
    "In these notebooks, we will discuss and show at a high level several packages in the RAPIDS ecosystem are as well as what they do. Subsequent notebooks will dive deeper into the various areas of data science and machine learning and show how you can use RAPIDS to accelerate your workflow in each of these areas."
